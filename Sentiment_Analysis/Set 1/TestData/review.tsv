The camera on this phone is incredible. The photos are clear, sharp, and full of detail. I'm able to take amazing photos with this phone, even in low-light conditions.
Not the greatest but good enough for the price.
Got the phone 2 years ago still in a pretty good condition although the screen to body ration is showing its age.
Kinda meh. Itâ€™s a really average phone.
I've only had this phone for a few months, and it's already cracked the screen. The phone is very fragile and not durable at all. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the phone.
This phone is very affordable for the quality of the product. I was able to find it for a great price, and I'm very happy with the value for the money.
This phone is not worth the money. There are much better phones on the market for a fraction of the price. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
I'm so disappointed with the battery life of this phone. It barely lasts a day on a single charge, even with moderate use. I'm constantly having to recharge it, which is a major inconvenience.
